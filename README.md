The Internet Vote Widget
------------------------
#### Help stop the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) with your web site!

[**Congress is on the verge of fast tracking the TPP**][1] a disastrous trade
agreement that would censor the Internet and destroy the American working class.
The goal of this project is to allow anyone with a web site to run their own
campaign to stop TPP. Simply embed a couple of lines of Javascript and you're
good to go!
